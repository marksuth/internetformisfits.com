      <h2>Get a website</h2>
      <p>The first step to having your own place on the web is well, having your own website. There are hundreds of ways
        you can go about building your own site, from hand coding every line from scratch, to having a WordPress site
        that will do most of the technical bits for you.</p>

      <h2>Own your Stuff</h2>
      <p>The internet is filled with billions of sites, yet many people tend to upload every part of their virtual self
        to just a handful of sites such as Facebook, Instagram or whatever Twitter’s called this week. By posting to
        your own site, you have complete control over how your photos, videos, text posts and audio look and work</p>

      <h2>Be yourself</h2>
      <p>It’s your website, so you have the ultimate freedom to just be yourself and show the world what interests you,
        and how you want to be seen online. Whereas with the main social media sites you’re restricted with how you can
        personalise your profile and what can or cannot be posted, along with expectations on how your present yourself
        on different platforms.</p>

      <h2>Create things</h2>
      <p>While having your own slice of the web is great, it’s only made better by posting to it. Whether it’s photos or
        video, a song or a podcast, or a piece of writing, there’s no expectation as to what you post, or what frequency
        you post. While it’s easy to get stuck in the trap of constantly perfecting your site, things truly come alive
        when you post your own creations for the world to see. Using tools like Bridgy also makes it possible to send
        your posts back to where your followers are, using POSSE</p>
